# Project Introduction

-   [SDUOJ](https://oj.qd.sdu.edu.cn/v2/home "SDUOJ") solutions, including solutions for homepage problems and classroom tests.
-   Homepage solutions generally don't include problem descriptions, while classroom tests usually do.
-   For code completion problems, complete solutions are typically provided.
-   Missing or incomplete solutions indicate that the author hasn't solved them yet.

# Programming Languages

-   C++, Python, and Java.

# Notes

-   SDUOJ problems may change over time. This project started in 2024.
-   ~~Most SDUOJ problems are not regularly updated, so problem statements may not be completely accurate or reliable.~~
-   This project is for reference only and does not guarantee complete accuracy.
-   Feel free to contact me for discussions about solution approaches and algorithms.
